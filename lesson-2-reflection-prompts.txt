What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git starts tracking the repository when that command is run.
This is done to start tracking the version of changes to my project

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

After adding files to the staging area, I can use git diff --staged to see the
difference between staged files and the last commit, and judge if the changes
belong to a logical unit or not before committing the changes.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

I may want to create a different version of the app I am working on, it helps to
have history of changes to either versions of my app separated

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

The branch graph helps to see how git determines its git log (for active or specified branch),
more than that, it helps to see unreachable commits, that could be lost if not branched off
ex git log branch_name OR git log [for active branch implicitly]

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

Merging 2 branches merges commits in one branch to commits in the checkout branch.
We represent it in the diagram the way we did to show that merging branches creates
a commit for the merge and updates the checked out commit to contain the result of
the merge

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

For manual merging, we are able to semantically determine how a conflict should be
resolved by understanding the logic behind the conflicts by talking to the authors
or seeing if we understand it ourselves and choose a resolution thereby choosing the
right solution, however if git attempts to resolve commits automatically, it might
not be able to decipher the true intentions of the authors.
