When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Most likely every time. This will act as a backup of sorts for my local
    repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It's better I decide when to pull changes manually from my remote repository as
    opposed to having git do this automatically for me as I may not want to pull in
    changes or even be aware of such changes by a collaborator to the remote repository,
    in order not to disrupt my workflow locally.
    It's better I explicitly sync in new changes to my local repository when I'm ready
    for it.
